## Todo

- [x] add functions to courseStore

- [x] page / popup to create new personas
- [ ] add specific durations instead of letting the user put whatever (for course gen)
- [ ] implement fetching and uploading in right places
- [x] add router guards
- [ ] improve prompting using real life structure
- [x] show course structure fully
- [x] make interactive course structure so that we can edit and refine
